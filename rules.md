# X-Team 63 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will create a list of tasks and each person will choose which one's they want.
No one person will get to choose all easy tasks and no person will be stuck with all hard tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will be sending regular messages and having check-ups each week when we meet up.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will message the group to request help or clarification.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Reminders and helpoing anyone that has difficulties with their part.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Everyone's opinion counts.
If you need help, ask for it.
Be kind to everyone
